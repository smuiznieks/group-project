# group-project
Let's practice collaborating on the same project!

## Set Up
Remember to `npm install` to get started. Execute `npm test` to run tests.

## TO DO:
- Add subtract.js 
- Add subtract.test.js
- Add multiply.js 
- Add multiply.test.js
- Add divide.js
- Add divide.test.js

Once those changes are complete, add more test cases and try implementing a variety of [common matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers)

- sum.test.js
- subtract.test.js
- multiply.test.js
- divide.test.js

If people are interested, I will think of more examples!

## How To
1. Create a new branch to work on `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (hint: no spaces in your branch name!)
2. Make code changes
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "info about my changes"`
5. `git push origin the-name-of-my-brain"` (no more pushing to main or master)

### Uh oh, I made changes on main and tried to push
You'll get the following error:
```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.
remote: error: At least 1 approving review is required by reviewers with write access.
To github.com:smuiznieks/group-project.git
 ! [remote rejected] main -> main (protected branch hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:smuiznieks/group-project.git'
```
